# Unsupervised Domain-Specific Deblurring via Disentangled Representations

Pytorch implementation of the paper [Unsupervised Domain-Specific Deblurring via Disentangled Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.01594.pdf). The proposed method is unsupervised and takes blurred domain-specific image (faces or text) as an input and procude the corresponding sharp estimate.

## Sample Results

TO BE ADDED...

## Dataset

To train the model, unpaired sharp and blurred images folders should be named in the following format: `datasets/name/trainA` and `datasets/name/trainB`. Test images can be stored in the same folder and you may choose your own folder name.

## Usage

### Data Preperation

In our experiment, face data is from [CelebA dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) and text data is from [BMVC text dataset](http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~ihradis/CNN-Deblur/). To manually blur the images, we use the method proposed in [DeblurGAN](https://github.com/KupynOrest/DeblurGAN/tree/master/motion_blur). The dataset are randomly split into three subsets: trainA (sharp), trainB(blur) and test set.

### Train

To train the model, run the following command line in the source code directory. You may set other parameters based on your experiment setting.

```bash
python train.py --dataroot ../datasets/DatasetName/ --name job_name --batch_size 2 --lambdaB 0.1 --lr 0.0002
```

### Test
Our pre-trained model for face and text can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P0mP8JjfdV55tDK7a3fIU4yghVmaUJyF?usp=sharing). To test the model, run the following command line in the source code directory. You may set other parameters based on your experiment setting. To choose the perceptual loss type as face, you need to manually set the VGG face model path in `network.py`. VGG_face pretrained model can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P0mP8JjfdV55tDK7a3fIU4yghVmaUJyF?usp=sharing).


```bash
python test.py --dataroot ../datasets/dataset_name/test_blur/ --num 1 --resume ../results/model/locations --name job_name --orig_dir ../datasets/dataset_name/test_orig --percep face
```
